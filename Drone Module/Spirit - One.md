### KEY FEATURES  
A proprietary dual-configuration airframe, designed and produced by Gadfin, with capabilities for alternating between a multirotor configuration for electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) and a fixed-wing configuration designed for long-range flights.

The IP65 waterproof aircraft is entirely electric, using a combination of LiPo batteries to power a set of 4 precision brushless motors for VTOL and Fuel-Cell technology powering the 5th pusher motor used for fast forward flight.

The Spirit-One can deliver payloads up to 5kg (11 lbs.) in 30 liters (1.2 ft3) compartment for a ground-breaking range of 250 km (155 miles) at a speed of 100km/h (62 mph).

The fully automated loading and unloading package compartment is safely housed within the vehicle's hull and designed to deliver life-saving sensitive medical supplies in a temperature-controlled environment.

The Spirit-One platform can also accommodate various sensors for long-range scanning operations of linear infrastructure such as roads, power lines, oil and gas pipelines, and more.

The Spirit-One has fully redundant safety systems, including an emergency parachute.
