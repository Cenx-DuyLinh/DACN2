>The Skiron Expeditionary sUAS (SKIRON-X) is a Group 2 sUAS that combines the simple operation of an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) configuration with the longer range and endurance of a fixed-wing design. It executes missions at undetectable altitudes and its EO/IR camera provides excellent ground resolution for airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).
