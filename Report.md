# Acquiring 15 m/s cruise speed
---
Given information: 
- Cruising height around 30m
- The airplane will be the tilted-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (TRUAV)
- The hardware can either be:
	- The old TRUAV from các anh Thịnh, Cường, Lợi 
	- Buying an empty airframe and then work from there
### Getting the old TRUAV
Since the airplane is already built an it has a cruise speed of 19m/s (worst case is that we will only get the old frame and nothing else) we need to redesign it, making the lift at 15m/s equal to the lift at 19m/s

TL;DR: **Decrease the cruise speed** 

> So how are we going to do it ? 
- Increase the lift coefficient of the aircraft
	1. Reduce the weight of the aircraft 
	2. Increase the angle of attack of the aircraft (Note: AOA can change to maximum ~6deg, [[NguyenGiaThinh|Reason why]])
	3. Add aerodynamics component:
		- Attach a leading edge device (Nose flaps, Kruger flaps, and slats)
		- Other stuff
		- Others: [Source to this stuff](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/courses/ase463q/design_pages/summer02/activewing/page009.html)
