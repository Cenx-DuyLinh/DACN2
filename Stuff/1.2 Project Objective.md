The primary objective of this project is to conduct analyzation of the Tilt-rotors VTOL UAV, previously constructed by Nguyen Gia Thinh, Trinh Vinh Loi , and Pham Minh Cuong, to conduct extensive research to modify the aircraft for the purpose of operating as an emergency surveillance platform. 
The aim is to assist rescue operations specifically in densely forested regions. By utilizing the combined advantages of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, these UAVs are capable of vertically taking off, hovering, and landing similar to a helicopter, while also enabling extended cruising flights comparable to those of conventional fixed-wing aircraft. This versatile capability is a fundamental characteristic that make them suitable for successful execution of large-scale area rescue missions.

The TRUAV will be used mainly for the Japan Innovation Challenge (JIC) 2023. This competition aims to accelerate research and development in the field of disaster-response robotics and increase the number of lives saved through the deployment of robots that can tackle various challenges. The competition will consist of three challenges: "Discovery," "Transportation," and "Rescue," which correspond to locating mannequins, delivering rescue packages, and retrieving mannequins using robots, respectively. In our project, we will primarily focus on the initial challenge, which involves identifying and localizing these mannequins in arduous and inclement environmental conditions. These conditions are characterized by harsh weather and heavy rainfall.
