In this project, our main goal is to take over the Tilt-rotors VTOL UAV from its predecessor then carry out research and reform the aircraft to serve as emergency surveillance platform to aid the rescue operation in dense forest environment. By utilizing the advantages of both fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, allow them to takeoff, hover and land vertically like a helicopter, while being able to perform long-distance cruising flight like a traditional fixed-wing aircraft. This versatility is key feature that make them a suitable for large area rescue mission. 

Based on the flight mission analysis of JIC - 2023, we come up with the following requirements for the Tilt-rotors VTOL UAV:

| No. | Aircraft requirements                                                                   | Parameter | Unit    |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1.  | Maximum operation range of                                                              |           | m       |
| 2.  | Payload                                                                                 |           | Kg      |

| 4.  | Minimum cruise air speed                                                                |           | m/s     |
| 5.  | Maximum altitude                                                                        |           | m       |
| 6.  | Operation temperatures                                                                  |           | C       |
| 7.  | VTOL from any terrain capability.                                                       |           |         |
| 8.  | Easy to operate and transport.                                                          |           |         |
| 9.  | Weather environmental resistance capabilities (Snow, strong wind, rain, turbulence,...) |           |         |
| 10. | Thermal / Night vision object recognition capabilities.                                 |           |         |
