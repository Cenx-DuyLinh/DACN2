# Problem statement
## Project introduction
---
In recent years, the interest in Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has significantly increased due to advancements in technology. These UAVs offer a unique combination of vertical take-off and landing capabilities, similar to a helicopter, along with extended cruising ability comparable to fixed-wing aircraft. VTOL UAVs have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including aerial surveillance, search and rescue operations, and transportation.

## Project objective 
---
The primary objective of this project is to conduct analyzation of the Tilt-rotors VTOL UAV, previously constructed by Nguyen Gia Thinh, Trinh Vinh Loi , and Pham Minh Cuong, to conduct extensive research to modify the aircraft for the purpose of operating as an emergency surveillance platform. 
The aim is to assist rescue operations specifically in densely forested regions. By utilizing the combined advantages of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, these UAVs are capable of vertically taking off, hovering, and landing similar to a helicopter, while also enabling extended cruising flights comparable to those of conventional fixed-wing aircraft. This versatile capability is a fundamental characteristic that make them suitable for successful execution of large-scale area rescue missions.

In this project, we will based on the scenario of the Japan Innovation Challenge (JIC) 2023. The main objective of this competition is to promote research and development in conducting unmanned vehicle operations to save lives during disasters, particularly in dense and hard-to-reach locations like mountains and forests.
The competition consists of three challenges: "Discovery," "Transportation," and "Rescue." These challenges involve locating mannequins, delivering rescue packages, and retrieving mannequins using robots, respectively. In our project, we will primarily focus on the initial challenge, which involves identifying and localizing these mannequins in bad environmental conditions. These conditions are characterized by harsh weather and heavy rainfall.

The challenge competition area will take place near the region mountain Setayama, Kamiotofuke, Kamishihoro, Kato District, Hokkaido 080-1407, Japan. Based on the document given by the committee, we can evaluate roughly some of the competitions condition.

## Problem to be solve
---
Based on the information provided in section 1.2, we can identify the main problems we need to address. These problems are listed in the table. For the first part of the project, we will focus more on the issues from 1 to 3. Our main objective is to learn and familiarize ourselves with the old TRUAV to understand the design decisions, electrical layouts, and other important aspects. This will help us to identify the areas that need improvement and propose manufacturing improvements to optimize the aircraft's weight. We will also conduct tests and evaluate the flight time of the TRUAV aircraft in copter mode and with the rotating tilt mechanism in cruise mode.

|No.|Issues|
|---|---|
|1|Gain an understanding of the basic principles and controls of tilt rotors.|
|2|Test and evaluate the flight time of the TRUAV aircraft in copter mode and with the rotating tilt mechanism in cruise mode.|
|3|Evaluate the structure of the TRUAV aircraft and propose manufacturing improvements to optimize its weight.|
|4|Conduct an analysis of the water resistance capabilities of the TRUAV aircraft and design appropriate measures to improve it.|
|5|Gain knowledge, analyze, and evaluate the operational conditions of the TRUAV aircraft in low-temperature environments.|
|6|Learn the theoretical foundations and design methods to give preliminary design parameters and 3D drawings of the TRUAV aircraft based on the old design.|
|7|Learn the theoretical basics to design and improve the aircraft structure suitable for the new mission.|
|8|Learn and compare the stability between the old and new designs of the TRUAV aircraft.|
|9|Test and evaluate the flight time and performance of the new design of the TRUAV aircraft in copter mode and with the rotating tilt mechanism in cruise mode.|

In the second part of the project, we will focus on issues 4 to 9. We will address several issues, including water resistance capabilities, operational conditions in low-temperature environments, theoretical foundations, design methods, and stability. By conducting these issues, we will be able to propose manufacturing improvements to optimize the aircraft's weight and ensure that it can operate effectively in heavy weather condition.
